This project was successful in emulating a Chat service comprising both a server and a client.

The project also has many features that make it scalable and easily maintainable. One issue that prevented the project to be more manageable was the way messages are in Quasar. They're not as flexible as, e.g., Erlang messages, in which we're not limited to the number of elements of the message neither their type.

Despite the fact that no major bugs were found, there is still room for improvement. 
Some tests should be developed to ensure that the system is running properly, to verify database performance and the communication between the GUI client and the server never fails. We think that a major improvement would be integrate the Notification Client in the Chat Client.

In conclusion, all the goal were meet and some further improvements were implemented. Therefore, we consider this a successful demonstration of a Chat Server.
