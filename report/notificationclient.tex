\subsection{Notification Client}
This client uses our Notification API to subscribe relevant events. This API is very similar to REST API endpoints. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
\textbf{:sub rooms} & subscribes rooms creation and removal\\
\hline
\textbf{:unsub rooms} & unsubscribes\\
\hline
\textbf{:sub room/name} & subscribes entries and exists in the room with that name\\
\hline
\textbf{:unsub room/name} & unsubscribes\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Notification API}
\end{table}

If in the future our service grows, and we have more publishers notifying other events,
this client demands no change.
